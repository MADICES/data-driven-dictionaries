# Data-driven data dictionaries 

We will parse preprints for techniques such as XAS, XPS, XANES to come up with dictionaries that, hopefully, inform 

- what the most important terms are 
- in which context they appear 

Which can then guide standardization efforts.

We will discuss our results with domain experts.
