# Data-driven data dictionaries 

We will parse preprints for techniques such as XAS, XPS, XANES to come up with dictionaries that, hopefully, inform 

- what the most important terms are 
- in which context they appear 

Which can then guide standardization efforts.

We will discuss our results with domain experts.

The scientific questions we can, hopefully, answer are: 
- can we create good vocabularies/dictionaries in this way 
- can we propose this as "minimal reporting standards" 
- how well does this work across domains? is this a good way to come up with minimal reporting standards for many different domains? 

## tools to read papers and create dictionaries

### pyamiimage
`pyamiimage`  extracts text from images. This can be useful for common axial labels in graphs, or for legands (what the substances are

### docanalysis 

extract words and phrases from text. The most immediate would be figure captions and tables captions
