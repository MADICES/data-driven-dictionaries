# Data-driven data dictionaries 

We will parse preprints for techniques such as XAS, XPS, XANES to come up with dictionaries that, hopefully, inform 

- what the most important terms are 
- in which context they appear 

Which can then guide standardization efforts.

We will discuss our results with domain experts.

The scientific questions we can, hopefully, answer are: 
- can we create good vocabularies/dictionaries in this way 
- can we propose this as "minimal reporting standards"
